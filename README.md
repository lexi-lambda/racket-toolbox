# toolbox

This library provides a collection of miscellaneous Racket utilities that I use in my personal projects but I have not felt warrant being published as a separate package. Note that this library is intentionally *not* published on the Racket package server, as **everything in this library should be considered unstable**. In projects that use it, I include this repository as a Git submodule, pinning to a specific version.
